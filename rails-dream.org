* Rails Dream
** Auto-Complete rails methods that are appropriate for the context
*** Find context
*** Gather list
*** Place it in a buffer
** Easily see all methods in a given context
*** Find context
*** Gather list
*** Class methods and Object methods
**** Would need to parse whether you are in def to determine if class methods or object methods are displayed
*** Possible implentation details
**** Find context by looking at superclass
**** rails c
***** ActionController::Base.instance_methods - Object.methods
***** ActionController::Base.methods - Object.methods

**** In depth
***** startup
****** Open shell
****** rails c
***** call
****** get SuperClass
****** ActionController::Base.instance_methods - Object.methods
****** ActionController::Base.methods - Object.methods
****** Copy output to buffer
****** Reformat

** On keystroke at end of rails method display args
*** ri form_tag -T
*** search for form_tag(
*** somehow display options
*** possibly try to cover edge cases like Options for form_tag
** On keystroke at end of rails method open documentation
*** ri form_tag -T
** Be able to search through the all the documentation, or through a set of methods
** Other Notes
*** Minor mode would be nice
*** Would prefer to make this work if rails changed
